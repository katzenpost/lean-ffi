# HACKING Lean FFI

Examples for Lean FFI to Rust and to C.

## building / running tests

The building of this lean package assumes you have a C compiler and a Rust compiler installed.

```bash

lake build
lake tests
```

## FFI examples

My FFI examples demonstrate doing some real world interactions between Lean and Rust for example
returned a pair, printing to stdout or calling a cryptographic function.
